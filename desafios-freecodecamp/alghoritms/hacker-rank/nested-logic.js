/*Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:
1 - If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.:fine=0) .
fine = 15 hackos x (the numbers of day late) 
2 - If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date,
3 - If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 hackos x (the numbers of months late) 
4 - If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of
1000 Hackos
